# ProPainter WebCam
A fork of ProPainter that combines the ProPainter repo with semantic segmentation via [Pixellib](https://github.com/ayoolaolafenwa/PixelLib) for live Video Inpainting.

When running the `webcam_propainter.py` script for the first time, the required model for Pixellib will be downloaded automatically and put in the weights folder.

This repo is a WIP with unoptimized code.
